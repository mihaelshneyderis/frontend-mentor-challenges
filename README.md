### What I learned
- The element that contains everything should be main instead of div.
- CSS variable naming conventions.
- Using min(desired value, 100%) to make it responsive on mobile.
- Use CSS reset to not have to do it manually.
- Set main to min 100vh so that content can be centered on page.
- Remember to use meta tags for SEO
### Continued development
- I want to get faster, I spent too much time overthinking minor code details that don't affect the design
- I want to get better at the basics
- I want to learn more about best practices
